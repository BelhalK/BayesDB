# BayesDB

This document aims to show a new way of exploring the College Scorecard dataset recently published by the U.S. Department of Education: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/.
The Economist triggered discussion about this dataset in an article describing a ranking system based only on earnings after graduation: http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2015/10/value-university
To explore trends in the data, we are going to use BayesDB.
